# üéí Inventory User Interface

## üïπÔ∏è Created for Cone's Claw Center

This open-source project powers the inventory mechanics and user interface for the Roblox game [Cone's Claw Center](https://www.roblox.com/games/83968111107511/Cones-Claw-Center). Written with passion in [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com/), along with JSX/TSX [React-lua](https://github.com/jsdotlua/react-lua).

## üõ†Ô∏è Building and Compiling

**NOTE:** This project is not intended for use outside of Cone's Claw Center, and is rather purely for code reference or personal educational purposes. Certain hierarchical elements in the local player require external scripts for instantiation and initialization or prior specific StarterGui setup, which this code is not particularly verbose about during runtime.

Necessary tools to be installed are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) and [Rojo](https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rojo/releases)

```
npm install
npm run build
rojo build -o model.rbxmx
```

Drag and drop model.rbxmx into your Roblox Studio place
